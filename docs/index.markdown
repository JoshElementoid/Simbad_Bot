# Current Features

## Voice Bot
{: .d-inline-block }
New
{: .label .label-green }
The server used to have a Voice Bot to create, delete, and control user-made voice channels, but the bot has recently stopped working (may it rest in peace).
Herb Bot has replicated most of Voice Bot's features, such as creating voice channels, and renaming those voice channels.


## Welcome Commands

Requested by many `Welcomers`, this command bundles together many steps for greeting new Simbians, such as giving them the beginning roles and pinging them in general.

# Upcoming Features

## Simbits Shop
I don't know about you but I had a metric <i>shitton</i> of Simbits that I was gonna use to flood the server with bad emotes. Coming soon!

## Role Toggle
The current role toggle bot is a nightmare. I plan to add a role toggle command to Herb Bot so we can have One Bot to Rule Them All.

## EDDB Stuff
Similar to commands such as `!from x to y`, I plan on adding commands that uses the EDDB/Inara data dumps. Stuff like finding the nearest finds the closest Stations/ISF/Material Traders, display the latest GalNet articles, etc.
